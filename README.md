# Diwali Sales Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali season to derive meaningful trends and patterns. Using Python, we performed data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior, product performance, and improve business strategies.

## Features

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized sales patterns across different customer segments.
- Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers by gender, age, state, marital status and occupation.
- Sales Insights: Identified top-selling products and seasonal demand spikes.
- Data Visualization: Illustrated insights using bar charts, heatmaps, and line plots.
